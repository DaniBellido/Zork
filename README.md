The game is a basic console app Zork like Game.

find a treasure that's been stolen from his village.

The castle contains a total of 9 rooms and the player
navigates them encountering diverse enemies and items.

The player has an inventory and can pick and drop items.
The player can also interact with chest and store items
in it. 

The game ends when the player dies(not implemented) or
reaches his goal (finding the treasure).

To finish the game the player must find a key that opens a locked chest.
type "info" to see all the actions the player can take.
